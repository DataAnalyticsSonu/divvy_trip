## Process
==========
1. Download the previous 1 month of Cyclistic trip data.
2. Unzip the files.
3. Create a folder on the desktop or Drive to house the files. Use appropriate file-naming conventions.
4. Open Excel and create a column called “ride_length.” Calculate the length of each ride by subtracting the column “started_at” from the column “ended_at” (for example, =D2-C2) and format as HH:MM:SS using Format > Cells >Time > 37:30:55.
5. Create a column called “day_of_week,” and calculate the day of the week that each ride started using the “WEEKDAY”command (for example, =WEEKDAY(C2,1)) in each file. Format as General or as a number with no decimals, noting that 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday.
6. Save the Processed data as data_processed.
