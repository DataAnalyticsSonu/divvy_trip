Options:
	* Calculate the mean of ride_length
	* Calculate the max ride_length
	* Calculate the mode of day_of_week
7. Create a pivot table to quickly calculate and visualize the data. 
Options:
	* Calculate the average ride_length for members and casual riders. 
	Try rows = member_casual; Values = Average of ride_length.
	* Calculate the average ride_length for users by day_of_week. 
	Try columns = day_of_week; Rows = member_casual; Values = Average of ride_length.
	* Calculate the number of rides for users by day_of_week by adding Count of trip_id to Values.

8. Save the file as data_analyized.csv .
